# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User needs are necessary while creating a program. Keeping in mind how a typical user would use the application prevents unnecessary content from being added into the application which can make the application more frustrating to use or feel too bloated. User stories are usually done by the product owner and then they are delivered to the development team. These users contain information about a user and that information is then translated to fit their needs in the application. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When I am developing, I program I tend to look for answers as I go through meeting each requirement. I try to meet those requirements and as I go, I debug the program. When I am done, I try to look for alternative ways in which the program can run faster and if there is any unnecessary code I remove it. I would like to implement scrum meetings more into my development cycle. These meetings can also be done by myself since I am looking to self-reflect on what I have done and what I should be doing. I also believe Kanban boards will be of great use to me in the future since it will help me be organized.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member in software development knows that the code they are writing with their team does not only belong to them. They are able to look past gaining achievements and work together with others to improve the code they are writing.
